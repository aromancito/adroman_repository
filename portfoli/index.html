                            <p>During my university journey, I delved into the realm of 3D Graphics in one of my modules. 
                                As a Mario Kart enthusiast, I chose to channel that passion into my project.
                                I crafted my own circuit and replicated essential in-game objects. It was my way of seamlessly 
                                blending my love for video games with my academic pursuits. How does that sound?

                                modelling what my future island would look like. 
                                It featured elements such as a cozy wooden house, a towering lighthouse, a majestic palm tree, 
                                and, of course, my own parcels of land. I couldn't forget to include my cherished jet ski to 
                                complete the scene! It was my way of visually shaping my island dreams.

                                creating a newsletter for the opening of a new brewery in Barcelona, named LUPUL artbeer. This 
                                newsletter provided details about the opening party, highlighting the brewery's unique features, 
                                along with information on prices, activities, tasting sessions, and the courses on offer. It 
                                was an opportunity to blend design creativity with promoting an exciting new beer destination

                                Infowave Adrians (since we share the same name), with the aim of building an IDR using tools 
                                such as ElasticSearch, Kibana, Logstash, among others.
                                It was a collaborative effort to showcase our skills in the field of systems and networks.

                                chose to create an MP3 player. This player not only reproduced melodies from iconic songs like 
                                "Despacito" by Luis Fonsi or the "Pirates of the Caribbean" theme but also featured a
